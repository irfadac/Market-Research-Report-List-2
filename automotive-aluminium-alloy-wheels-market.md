<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Aluminium Alloy Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive aluminium alloy wheels are primarily produced using three different methods: casting, forging, and other methods. Casting involves pouring molten aluminium into a mould to create the wheel shape, resulting in a cost-effective and versatile option. Forging uses high-pressure techniques to shape the wheel out of a solid piece of aluminium, producing a stronger and more durable wheel. Other methods may include spinning or machining the wheel from a solid block of aluminium, offering unique designs and customization options. Each method has its own benefits and is preferred based on specific requirements.</p></p>
