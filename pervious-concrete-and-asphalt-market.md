<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Concrete and Asphalt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pervious concrete and porous asphalt are types of permeable pavement that allow water to easily pass through them, reducing stormwater runoff and preventing flooding. Pervious concrete is a mix of cement, water, and aggregates with minimal fine particles, creating a porous surface. Porous asphalt is similar but uses asphalt instead of concrete. Both types of pavement offer environmental benefits by filtering pollutants and recharging groundwater. They are commonly used in parking lots, sidewalks, and driveways to manage stormwater runoff effectively.</p></p>
