<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Floor Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li><li>Non-Solvent Polyurethane Floor Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane floor coatings are divided into two main types: solvent-based and non-solvent-based. Solvent polyurethane floor coatings contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate during the curing process, while non-solvent polyurethane floor coatings do not contain VOCs and are considered more environmentally friendly. Solvent-based coatings typically offer better durability and scratch resistance, while non-solvent coatings are preferred for their low odor and reduced health risks. Both types provide excellent protection and aesthetics for various commercial and industrial flooring applications.</p></p>
