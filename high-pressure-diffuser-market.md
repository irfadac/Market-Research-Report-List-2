<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Diffuser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Filter</li><li>Without Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High pressure diffuser market can be categorized into two types: with filter and without filter. Diffusers with filter are equipped with a filtration system that removes contaminants from the air before it is released, improving air quality. On the other hand, diffusers without a filter do not have this feature, making them more cost-effective but offering lower air purification benefits. Customers can choose between these two options based on their specific needs and budget considerations.</p></p>
