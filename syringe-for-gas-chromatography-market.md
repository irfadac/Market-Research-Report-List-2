<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Syringe for Gas Chromatography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Syringes</li><li>Auto Syringes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Syringes for gas chromatography come in two main types: manual syringes and auto syringes. Manual syringes require the user to manually inject the sample into the chromatograph, providing more control over the injection process. Auto syringes, on the other hand, are automated and can inject samples automatically, allowing for higher throughput and less user intervention. Both types of syringes are commonly used in gas chromatography for accurately injecting samples into the instrument for analysis.</p></p>
