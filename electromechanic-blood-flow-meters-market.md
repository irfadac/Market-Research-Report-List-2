<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromechanic Blood Flow Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sine Wave</li><li>Square Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromechanic blood flow meters are devices used to measure the movement of blood through the body. Two common types in the market are Sine Wave and Square Wave meters. Sine Wave meters produce a smooth and continuous wave pattern, providing accurate readings of blood flow. Square Wave meters, on the other hand, generate a more abrupt and distinct wave pattern, suitable for detecting rapid changes in blood flow. Both types have their own applications in medical settings for monitoring and diagnosing conditions related to blood circulation.</p></p>
