<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Rod Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PAN-Based Carbon Fiber Rod</li><li>Pitch-Based Carbon Fiber Rod</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PAN-based carbon fiber rods are made from polyacrylonitrile fibers, which are heated and stretched to align the carbon atoms, resulting in a strong and lightweight material. These rods are commonly used in aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods industries for their high strength-to-weight ratio. Pitch-based carbon fiber rods, on the other hand, are derived from petroleum pitch and offer even greater strength and stiffness than PAN-based rods. They are often used in high-performance applications where maximum durability is required.</p></p>
