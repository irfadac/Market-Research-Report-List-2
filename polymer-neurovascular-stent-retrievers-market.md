<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer neurovascular stent retrievers are classified into two main types: balloon-expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expanding stents use a balloon to expand the stent and ensure it stays in place, while self-expanding stents use a mesh-like structure that expands on its own once inserted. Both types of stents are used in neurovascular procedures for structural support and to remove blood clots in the brain. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the patient and the preferences of the healthcare provider.</p></p>
