<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional Fire Alarm System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One Initiating Circuit</li><li>Multi-initiating Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A conventional fire alarm system with one initiating circuit has a single circuit loop that connects all the detectors and devices in the building. When one detector detects smoke or heat, the alarm is activated. In contrast, a system with multi-initiating circuits has multiple circuit loops, allowing for more precise identification of the location of the fire. This type of system can provide faster response times and minimize false alarms by pinpointing the exact area of the fire.</p></p>
