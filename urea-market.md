<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urea Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Large Granule Urea</li><li>Small Granule Urea</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large granule urea and small granule urea are two types of urea markets that cater to different consumer needs. Large granule urea is preferred for application in agriculture and landscaping due to its slower release of nitrogen, which provides consistent nutrient availability for plants over a longer period of time. On the other hand, small granule urea is more suitable for industrial applications, such as the production of resins and adhesives, due to its rapid dissolution and dispersion properties. Both markets offer unique benefits to users in their respective industries.</p></p>
