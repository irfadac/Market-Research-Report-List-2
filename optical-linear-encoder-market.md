<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Linear Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axle Type</li><li>Shaft Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical linear encoders are used in motion control systems to accurately measure linear displacement. There are two main types of optical linear encoders based on their design: axle type and shaft type. Axle type encoders are integrated directly into the axle of the system, providing a direct measurement of linear displacement. Shaft type encoders, on the other hand, are mounted externally on the shaft of the system, providing a non-contact measurement of linear displacement. Both types offer high precision and reliability in various applications.</p></p>
