<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cement Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Solid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cement foam can be classified into two main types: liquid and solid. Liquid cement foam involves the creation of a foam by mixing a foaming agent with a liquid cement mixture, resulting in a lightweight material suitable for insulation and filling applications. On the other hand, solid cement foam is produced by adding a foaming agent directly to the cement mixture, creating a lightweight material with structural strength that is commonly used in construction for insulation and lightweight concrete applications.</p></p>
