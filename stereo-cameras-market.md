<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stereo Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-of-flight</li><li>Stereo Vision</li><li>Structured Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stereo Cameras are used in various industries and applications such as robotics, automotive, healthcare, and surveillance. There are three main types of stereo camera technologies - Time-of-flight, Stereo Vision, and Structured Light. Time-of-flight cameras measure the time it takes for light to bounce off objects and return to the camera, providing accurate depth information. Stereo Vision uses two cameras to create 3D images by comparing the difference in perspective. Structured Light projects a pattern onto objects and uses the distortion of the pattern to calculate depth information.</p></p>
