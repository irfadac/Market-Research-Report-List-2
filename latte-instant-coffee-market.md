<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latte Instant Coffee Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray-drying</li><li>Freeze-drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Latte instant coffee is available in two main market types: spray-drying and freeze-drying. Spray-drying involves spraying hot liquid coffee into a chamber where it quickly dries into a fine powder. This method is cost-effective and commonly used for producing large quantities of instant coffee. Freeze-drying, on the other hand, involves freezing the brewed coffee into ice, then removing the ice through sublimation, leaving behind a soluble powder. This method preserves the coffee's flavor and aroma better than spray-drying, but it is more expensive.</p></p>
