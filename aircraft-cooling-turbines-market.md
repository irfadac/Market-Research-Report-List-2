<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Cooling Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan Cooling Turbines</li><li>Compressor Cooling Turbines</li><li>Compressor Fan Cooling Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft cooling turbines play a crucial role in maintaining optimal operating temperatures in aircraft engines. There are three main types of aircraft cooling turbines - fan cooling turbines, compressor cooling turbines, and compressor fan cooling turbines. Fan cooling turbines use an external fan to provide cooling air to the engine, while compressor cooling turbines use air from the engine compressor for cooling. Compressor fan cooling turbines combine both methods by using a combination of external fan air and compressor air for cooling purposes.</p></p>
