<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airless Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial tires are constructed with cords that run at right angles to the direction of travel, providing better flexibility and grip on the road. These tires are known for their durability and smooth ride quality. On the other hand, bias tires have cords that run diagonally across the tire, making them less flexible and more prone to heat buildup. Bias tires are typically more affordable than radial tires but may not offer the same level of performance and longevity.</p></p>
