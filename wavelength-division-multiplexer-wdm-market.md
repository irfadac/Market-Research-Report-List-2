<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexer (CWDM)</li><li>Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (DWDM)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology that combines multiple optical signals on a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of light. The two main types of WDM are Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexer (CWDM) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (DWDM). CWDM has wider spacing between wavelengths, making it more cost-effective for short-distance communication. On the other hand, DWDM has narrower spacing between wavelengths, allowing for higher data capacity and longer transmission distances, making it ideal for long-haul networks.</p></p>
