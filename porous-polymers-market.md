<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Porous Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline State</li><li>Amorphous State</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Porous polymers can exist in two main types in terms of their molecular structure: crystalline state and amorphous state. Crystalline porous polymers have a highly ordered molecular arrangement, resulting in well-defined pore structures and higher stability. On the other hand, amorphous porous polymers have a random molecular arrangement, leading to more flexibility in pore size and shape. Both types have unique properties and applications in various industries such as gas storage, catalysis, and separations.</p></p>
