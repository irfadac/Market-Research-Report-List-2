<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neonatal ICU ventilators are medical devices used to deliver breathable air into the lungs of premature or critically ill newborn babies who are unable to breathe on their own. There are two main types of ventilators - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require inserting a tube into the baby's airway, while non-invasive ventilators deliver oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs. Both types of ventilators help support the baby's breathing and improve their oxygen levels, aiding in their recovery and overall health.</p></p>
