<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gear Reducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Orthogonal</li><li>Parallel-shaft</li><li>Coaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Worm gear reducers can be classified into three main types based on their design and structure: orthogonal, parallel-shaft, and coaxial. Orthogonal worm gear reducers have the input and output shafts positioned at 90 degrees to each other, making them suitable for applications where space is limited. Parallel-shaft worm gear reducers have the input and output shafts aligned in the same direction, making them ideal for high-torque applications. Coaxial worm gear reducers have the input and output shafts concentrically positioned, providing smoother and more efficient power transmission.</p></p>
