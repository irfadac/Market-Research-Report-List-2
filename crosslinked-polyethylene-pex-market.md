<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crosslinked Polyethylene (PEX) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)</li><li>Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crosslinked Polyethylene (PEX) is a type of polyethylene that has been modified through a crosslinking process to enhance its properties. PEX is commonly divided into two main market types: High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE). HDPE offers a higher strength-to-density ratio and is commonly used in applications where rigidity and strength are required. On the other hand, LDPE is more flexible and has higher impact resistance, making it suitable for applications where flexibility is key.</p></p>
